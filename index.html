            Week 2 8/28-9/1 second journal entry. Today was an odd day and I have a free period. And i go to mtb at 4:00 with Andrew. I learned enegering saftey
            and how to make my own website. I learned that my team except a few people on my team were good at rolling the marble. Someone in our team 
            thought they were the ref and was bossing everybody around. We learned about OSHA and how they work for workers saftey on the jobsite.

            Week 3 9/5-9/8 third journal entry. We learned how to use tinker cad and how to 3D modle. On tinker cad we started to modle out Rube Goldburg
            project. Our chalendge was to make a home applaince.
            Week 3 9/5-9/8 fourth journal entry. We finished our tinker CAD today and we started to make our Rube Goldburg
            project Andrew does not know how to use a box cutter and Evan is useless. We cut out our base and started cutting out our towers/tower supports.
            We also had out first test today, I think I did good.

            Week 4 9/11-9/15 fourth journal entry. We tested our Rube Goldburg project. But it did not want to work. We had to change some many things and 
            fix so many things, but enentualy we got it to work. In our project we used wheel/axel, lever and inclined slope. It took forever... 
            I was releaved when we finally got it to work. I am proud of it. Monday we will learn how to put a video of our project on our website.
