            is complex and requires a lot of steps. I am gald i got the website done a looking foward to updating it further.

            and how to make my own website. I learned that my team except a few people on my team were good at rolling the marble. Someone in our team 
            thought they were the ref and was bossing everybody around. We learned about OSHA and how they work for workers saftey on the jobsite.

            project. Our chalendge was to make a home applaince.
            Week 3 9/5-9/8 fourth journal entry. We finished our tinker CAD today and we started to make our Rube Goldburg
            project Andrew does not know how to use a box cutter and Evan is useless. We cut out our base and started cutting out our towers/tower supports.
            We also had out first test today, I think I did good.

            Week 4 9/11-9/15 fourth journal entry. We tested our Rube Goldburg project. But it did not want to work. We had to change some many things and 
            fix so many things, but enentualy we got it to work. In our project we used wheel/axel, lever and inclined slope. It took forever... 
            I was releaved when we finally got it to work. I am proud of it. Monday we will learn how to put a video of our project on our website.

            Week 5 9/18-9/22 fith journal entry. This week we made our paper boats and saw how much weigh they could hold. I made a solid boat that floated. The 
            materails I used were paper, sisors, and tape. My boat was ablt to hold 86.2 grams for the full 5 minutes. Unfortunately my boat did not hold the most
            weight fot the longest time.

            Week 6 9/25-9/29 sixth journal entry. This week me and Evan took apart a computer and put it back togheter without breaking anything. We took it apart
            and put it back toghter really fast. One of the fastest time our teacher has evey seen. We learned a lot about computer parts and what there job is 
            inside of a computer. Each component plays an important role in makinf the computer function properly.

        Week 7 9/30-10/6 seveth journal entry. This week we learned about Bio Engineering and how it works in our own life. Bio engineering uses lots of differt
        types of engineering like eletricail, mechanical, computer, etc. Bio engineering makes things like prosthetics and artifical hearts. This week we also 
        made working hand out of cardboard, string, and tape. We had to be able to pick up a water bottle with our hand. We accomplished this but it was diffcult,
        for example about half way through or project i got a bloody nose and had to step out for a while, becasue of this we only had 3 working fingers and a non
        working thumb. The had did its job but not very well. I like learning bout Bio engineering.

        Week 8 10/9-10/13 eight jorunal entry. This week we learned about Areospace Enginnering. I learned about thrust, lift, drag, and gravity. I learned about
        how all these things either help and don't help a plane/rocket fly. Areospace is easier to get into if you know someone who works in areospace. Areospace
        enegering pays well because it is a small class and people know what they are doing. On tinker CAD we designed a bottle rocket and next week we will test
        them and see if they fly.
        </p>

        Week 9 10/16-10/20 ninth journal entry. This week we made our bottle rocket. I was partners with Daron. we made a good lookin rocket with a tail
        stablizer and big wings. We also used a lot a lot of hott gule. We tested out bottle rocket Thursday, the first launch our pencil which was the guide rode
        got stuck in the slot. The second attempt we took off the penciel and to flew not very far or straight but it didnt fly the shortest which was good. We had
        60 psi in our rocket.

        Week 10//22-10/27 tenth journal entry. This week I learned about enviromental enegering and how it works in our daily lifes. Envirmental enegering focuses
        on trying to protect our envirment and how to have safe and healthy land and resources. Our project this week was to make a water filter. We made our
        filter with cotton balls, sand, pebbles, rocks. Our filter worked ok, it filtered the bigger stuff out like sticks and dirt. At the end our water was still
        a little bit yellow. One group got clear water but they cheated, they only had materails like we did cotton balls, sand, pebbles, rocks, dirty water,
        and water bottle. They used clean clear water to clean out there filter after every round, but the materails list did not have clean clear water on it.
