            Week 1 8/21-8/25 Hello world. This is the first journal entry on the new website. It was kinda chalendging trying to make a website. Making a website
            is complex and requires a lot of steps. I am gald i got the website done a looking foward to updating it further.

            Week 2 8/28-9/1 second journal entry. Today was an odd day and I have a free period. And i go to mtb at 4:00 with Andrew. I learned enegering saftey
            and how to make my own website. I learned that my team except a few people on my team were good at rolling the marble. Someone in our team 
            thought they were the ref and was bossing everybody around. We learned about OSHA and how they work for workers saftey on the jobsite.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Week 3 9/5-9/8 third journal entry. We learned how to use tinker cad and how to 3D modle. On tinker cad we started to modle out Rube Goldburg
            project. Our chalendge was to make a home applaince.
            Week 3 9/5-9/8 fourth journal entry. We finished our tinker CAD today and we started to make our Rube Goldburg
            project Andrew does not know how to use a box cutter and Evan is useless. We cut out our base and started cutting out our towers/tower supports.
            We also had out first test today, I think I did good.

            Week 4 9/11-9/15 fourth journal entry. We tested our Rube Goldburg project. But it did not want to work. We had to change some many things and 
            fix so many things, but enentualy we got it to work. In our project we used wheel/axel, lever and inclined slope. It took forever... 
            I was releaved when we finally got it to work. I am proud of it. Monday we will learn how to put a video of our project on our website.

            Week 5 9/18-9/22 fith journal entry. This week we made our paper boats and saw how much weigh they could hold. I made a solid boat that floated. The 
            materails I used were paper, sisors, and tape. My boat was ablt to hold 86.2 grams for the full 5 minutes. Unfortunately my boat did not hold the most
            weight fot the longest time.

            Week 6 9/25-9/29 sixth journal entry. This week me and Evan took apart a computer and put it back togheter without breaking anything. We took it apart
            and put it back toghter really fast. One of the fastest time our teacher has evey seen. We learned a lot about computer parts and what there job is 
            inside of a computer. Each component plays an important role in makinf the computer function properly.

        Week 7 9/30-10/6 seveth journal entry. This week we learned about Bio Engineering and how it works in our own life. Bio engineering uses lots of differt
        types of engineering like eletricail, mechanical, computer, etc. Bio engineering makes things like prosthetics and artifical hearts. This week we also 
        made working hand out of cardboard, string, and tape. We had to be able to pick up a water bottle with our hand. We accomplished this but it was diffcult,
        for example about half way through or project i got a bloody nose and had to step out for a while, becasue of this we only had 3 working fingers and a non
        working thumb. The had did its job but not very well. I like learning bout Bio engineering.
        </p>

        Week 8 10/9-10/13 eight jorunal entry. This week we learned about Areospace Enginnering. I learned about thrust, lift, drag, and gravity. I learned about
        how all these things either help and don't help a plane/rocket fly. Areospace is easier to get into if you know someone who works in areospace. Areospace
        enegering pays well because it is a small class and people know what they are doing. On tinker CAD we designed a bottle rocket and next week we will test
        them and see if they fly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Week 9 10/16-10/20 ninth journal entry. This week we made our bottle rocket. I was partners with Daron. we made a good lookin rocket with a tail
        stablizer and big wings. We also used a lot a lot of hott gule. We tested out bottle rocket Thursday, the first launch our pencil which was the guide rode
        got stuck in the slot. The second attempt we took off the penciel and to flew not very far or straight but it didnt fly the shortest which was good. We had
        60 psi in our rocket.
        </p>

        Week 10/22-10/27 tenth journal entry. This week I learned about enviromental enegering and how it works in our daily lifes. Enviromental engering focusses
        on trying to protect our daily lifes. Envirometal engering focuses on trying to protect our enriroment and how to have safe and healthy land/resources. Our
        project this week was to make a water filter. We made our water filter with cotton balls, sand, pebbles, rocks. Our filter worked ok, it filtered the bigger
        stuff out like sticks and dirt. At the end our water was still a little bit yellow
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Week 11 10/30-11/3 eleventh journal entry. This week we learned about electrical engineergin. We learned about volts, amps, current, and oms. Volts are how
        much energy is flowing. Amps is how much can be discharged with in a certain time(flow). Current how much is flowing. Oms is resitance. We made a breadboard
        curcits 3 of them. They got more complacted as they went up. We learned aboub anoides and didoes, and ground. The breadboard was able to light up.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Week 12 11/6-11/11 We worked on Lab 3 and 4 and building circuits from a breadboard. We used resistors and LED's to create circuits in series and parallel.
        We used Arduino coding to program the circuit. It was somewhat diffcult to understand but eventually we understood and were able to get the breadboard set
        up propperly. We used the Arduion to program the light and have them blink at dudffernt times.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Week 13 11/13-11/18 This week we learned about Business Engineering.We learned about what goes on in busneiss engineering, for example the job like marketing,
        finance, project managment, marketing, laws and ethics. We also started brainstorming a shark tank idea in our groups. Our group made an app that helps find 
        scolarships.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Week 14 11/25-12/31 We talked about our pitch and did some research. Our pitch was an app that helped find scolarships for highschool kids. Our app took
        demographics, gardes, transcripts and looked for scolarships that you could apply for. My favirote pitch was our pitch because it was the best and made the
        most sence.

        Week 15 1/8-1/12 1.Our bridge weighted 46kg and 63.5kg. 2.Our bridge help 2035kg and 1430kg of water. 3.The ratio was 44 and 33. 4.The heavest part of our bridge
        was the pasta and glue. 5.The design of our bridge came from reasearch and other bridge designs. 6.The second bridge design worked better than the first. 7.The
        point of failure was the middle. Using more glue and pasta.

        S2Week 1 1/8-1/12. This week we leanred about chemical engineering. We learned what chemical enegeers do. We learned about the different types of feilds you can
        go into. We learned the difference between a chemist and a chemical enegeers. Chemical engering makes the scaled up systems to handle the manafacturing process.
        The project this week was ublec. The ublec we made was almost perfect but had a little to much water.
       </p>
       
       <p>
        S2Week 2 1/15-1/19. This week we did our project proposal. We did research about how to make a house trap car and how to make it go far. We watched a Mark Rober
        video. We want to make a long lever arm and big rear wheels. We want to reduce friction so that our car rolls easy. We also want to make it light weight to that
        it is easier for the mouse trap car to move. Our car should go straight and far if made correctly.
       </p>
       
       <p>
        S2Week 3 1/22-1/26. This week we finialized our mousetrap car design. We finished our calculations for our car. We plan to start building our mouse trap car
        this week. We will build the body wheels/axels and the drive from the mouse trap to the car. We alos plan to make changes to make our car better and go further.
       </p>
       
       <p>
        S2Week 4 1/28-2/3 This week we started building our muse trap car. We made our frame out of cardboard, wheels were CD's. We have just about finished our car and
        we tested it and it went about 34 feet. Our wheels are a little wobbly. Our plans fir next week are to make the stick flatter to inclears pulling distance on the 
        string.
       </p>
       
       <p>
        S2Week 5 2/5-2/9 Our car isn't going straight is the only flaw. Our second design will have a longer pull rod and a lightter body. Our longest distance recorded
        so far has been 60 ft. Our percent error was i belive 30%. Emma has the math for percent error. We have so far just been testing and imporving our current car.
        The next steep will be to make our second version with all of the improvements.
       </p>
       
       <p>
        S2Week 6-7 (2/5-2/9)-(2/12-2/19) The past we have finished prototype one and started on our final car. We made our car differnent this time, we had our pull rode
        longer, lighter body. This all helped our car go farther. The flaw in our design was that is wouldnt go straight and was a little bit to fast. The reason our car
        didnt go straight was because the front wheels werent square to the back wheels. The second design will be lighter and will hopefully go straighter, our second
        design will also have alonger pull rod. Our perdicted distance is +70ft. Our first design went about 53-60ft. The percent error in our design is 30%. The process
        to making our car so far is just buliding slowly and improving what we can.
